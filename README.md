# Ambridge Issue Tracker

This is an *unofficial* issue tracker for the [Borough of Ambridge](http://www.ambridgeboro.org/) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambridge,_Pennsylvania)). It is a citizens' initiative to foster greater collaboration on issues concerning our town. Have an idea? Then ...

No ideas off the top of your head? Then go see [what we're already working on](https://github.com/Ambridge/Ambridge/issues).

# [Go browse issues!](https://github.com/Ambridge/Ambridge/issues)

Think of this like a shared "todo" list. Let's get on the same page and communicate about what we're all working on, so that we can make progress towards common goals! :-)
